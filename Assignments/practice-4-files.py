# Practice problem 1:

# properly import the "utils.py" library. You can do it however you want.
# Run this code and make sure that "utils loaded successfully" prints.


# Note: you are absolutely allowed to change things in the utils.py file,
# But (like any professional coding environment), you should ensure that
# any code you write will still run and work with the default utils.py!


# Practice problem 2:
# (this one is review for for loops)
# What is the average result of a D20 rolled with advantage?
# Write whatever code you need to determine this answer below.





# Answer in a comment here:
"""
This many times
"""
# No, googling the answer is not good enough
    # (but you can use that to check your work!)



# Practice problem 3:
# Go ahead and download and run that "Utils testing" file and fiddle
# around for a bit.
    # How many zombies are needed so that they have a 1% chance to win?
    # How many zombies are needed so that they have a 66% chance to win?
    # How many zombies are needed so that they have a 99% chance to win?
# There's another file I made on the website called "fightSimulation.txt"
# That file is the result of a huge number of fights from the demo code!
# How many times did the troll win total?

# Yes, you'll probably need to write some file parsing here.




# Practice problem 4:
# Write a function called "monsterFromFile"
# That takes the name of a file as an argument.
# This function will find out the monster's armor class, attack bonus,
# damage dice, damage bonus, and even name. It will return a monster
# With all of this information properly allocated. This way you can
# define monsters much more easily! You just have to say something like
# skeleton = monsterFromFile('skeleton.monster')
# And that's all you need! So much simpler.



# Once you've written the function, finish it out by downloading
# the acolyte and skeleton files from the website





# Practice problem 5:
# Copy the "fightManyRoll" function from utils.py here.
# Change the name to "fightManyRollPrint"
# At the end of each fight, this function will append to a file
# (call the file whatever you want) the following information:
# - A fight has just occurred
# - The winner
# - how many monsters fought on each side
# - The names of all the monsters involved
# - The total remaining current HP of the winning side



# Now, have one skeleton fight two acolytes
# a couple times in this new function.
