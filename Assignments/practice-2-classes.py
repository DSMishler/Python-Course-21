# Practice problem 1
# Here's a random seed.
import random
random.seed(0)
# Run this program. What does the following print function output?
print(random.randint(1,20))
# It outputs: _____
# Now CHANGE the Random seed so that it outputs a 20 first, every time.
# You may have to do some guess and check.

# Practice problem 2
# There are other methods in "random" that exist.
# For example, random can generate real numbers randomly, too.
# Make a print statement below that prints a random *real* number
# Between 0 and 1.
# Yes, I just asked you to use the internet to find out how to do it.
# The ability to find what you need to solve problems is the key
# To being a great programmer.

# Practice problem 3
# Create a class called "Dog"
# The "Dog" has a member variable called mood
    # It should be initialized to "playful"
# The "Dog" should have two member functions.
    # The first should be called "play()" and sets its mood to "hungry"
    # The second should be called "feed()" and sets its mood to "playful"

# Practice problem 4
# Remember how we made a Die class in class?
# Go ahead and copy-paste that code below. Then add a new method to
# the class. Call this method "Advantage()".
# The method will roll twice and return the higher of the two rolls.


# Practice problem 5
# Remember how we made a Die class in class?
# You don't *have* to have dice use the randint function for your
# Random number generation. Check this out: I can create a "rigged"
# die like this. (When you get here, remove the commenting ''' and try it)
'''
outcomes = [1,1,2,3,6,6]
for i in range(10): # Do the following 10 times.
    index = random.randint(1,6) - 1 # could also say randint(0,5)
    print(outcomes[index])
'''
# Use this idea to create a class that rolls a 20-sided die,
# except instead of having all numbers 1-20, skip 19 and replace it
# with 20.
